# Infections-Spread-Influence-Maximization
A repository to supplement the paper "Modeling the Spread of Infectious Diseases through Influence Maximization".

### Included files

Inputs -  the connected Watts-Strogatz small-world graphs we used in the paper 

SI.ipynb, SIS.ipynb, SIR.ipynb - three LT optimization models provided in the paper


### Requirements
